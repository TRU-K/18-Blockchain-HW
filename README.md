# 19-Blockchain-Wallets-HW
This repo contains homework for unit 18 of my fintech course.

## Intention
You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Description
This task required me to utilize skills learnt using streamlit and python code to create a mock blockchain that can; add blocks to the chain, validate the chain, change the difficulty of the block hashing and explore details of blocks within the chain.

## Code Output
